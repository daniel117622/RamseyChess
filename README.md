Welcome to the **RamseyChess **! This is the place where chess enthusiasts of all levels can come together to explore the world of chess, learn new strategies, and stay up to date with the latest news in the chess community.

## About RamseyChess Blog

The RamseyChess Blog is dedicated to providing insightful content for both beginners and advanced players. Unlike traditional chess platforms, this blog isn't about moving pieces and winning individual games against others; it's a mind game, where you get to decide what's valuable on the board. We focus on understanding how different players value pieces and make decisions, helping you reflect on and analyze your own thought patterns.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Chess Strategy Articles**: Learn different strategies from classic openings to advanced endgame techniques.
- **Tips for Improvement**: Practical tips to help you enhance your skills and play better chess.
- **Explore Piece Valuation**: Understand how different piece values can influence your game and experiment with your own strategies.

## How This Platform Works

This platform helps you understand your chess thought patterns by allowing you to experiment with piece valuation and strategic depth. In the **Sandbox** section, you can freely assign values to chess pieces and determine the bot's thinking depth. This determines how many moves ahead the bot will consider, and lets you see how these adjustments impact gameplay.

For example, at a depth of 1, the bot will look at all possible next moves and choose the best one based on the values you assign. At depth 2, it will consider both its own move and its opponent's response, enabling it to make decisions involving trades. As you progress, you can tune additional parameters, such as control of the center or space advantage, to further refine your strategies.

## Play Against AI

To help you get started with building your own strategies, you can also play against predefined AI bots with unique approaches:

- **The Pawn Gobbler**: This bot relentlessly pursues pawns, trying to capture every single one.
- **The inverted**: Literally switched piece values, it will try to lose
As the platform develops, more sophisticated bots will be introduced, including those that value closed positions and strategic movement restrictions.

## Medium term plans:
Aside from evaluating only material. The following parameters are for certain to be added, as well as some sort of configuration to change their wheights over time:
