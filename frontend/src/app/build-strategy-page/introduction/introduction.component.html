<h2 class="w-100 text-center">🎉 <strong>Welcome to the Strategy Wizard!</strong> 🎉 <br><br> </h2>
<p class="wizard-intro">
    
    
    Here you can <strong>design your strategy</strong> and set your own rules for how to play. <br><br>
    
    📝 You will be prompted with <strong>forms</strong> where you can assign values to your pieces and decide how to evaluate chess positions. <br><br>
    
    💾 After finishing the setup, you can <strong>save this strategy as a "card"</strong>. This card can be used later to <strong>challenge other players</strong> or face off against AI bots. <br><br>
    
    🧠 <em>Be wise with your decisions...</em> every choice counts in the game! <br>
